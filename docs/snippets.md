# Snippets

A snippet is not too far removed from a [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com) but with added context around what it might be useful for.

I've got a bunch of stuff in my [junkcode](https://github.com/marcus-crane/junkcode) folder but no great way to explain what it's for. This way, I can also keep junk code snipppets in my repo as well which is neat. It kinda moves it away from Github Gists or any source control provider in general even though I'll still keep a copy in one.

## Metadata

The content block for a snippet would look a little like this:

```
