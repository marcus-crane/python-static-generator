# Reviews

I don't generally write reviews anymore but I used to have a bunch from back when I ran a site called [Neat Games](https://neatgam.es). It was just an excuse to write more but that's a story for another day.

I'd like to keep them around just as a reminder of if/how much I've improved.

The trick part here would be storing reviews in a way that is medium agnostic. If I wanted to write a review about a movie, I can't specify reviews in a way that assumes the medium.

I suppose at this point, having tags would make sense because sorting by platform could be useful.

## Metadata

The content block for a review would look a little like this:

```
---
type: review
title: Gitaroo Man
medium: videogame
tags:
	- ps2
	- psp
year: 1970
lang: python
header: /img/header/gitaroo-man.jpg
---

Here is my neato project. I've written some stuff about it.
```
