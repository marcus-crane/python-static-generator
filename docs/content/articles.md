# Articles

Articles are kind of what they say on the tin. They're what you would consider blog posts but written to be kinda lengthy and in depth.

They'd probably end up leaning towards being kinda philosophical but they're definitely not intended to be pretentious, haha.

They differ from [thoughts](/docs/content/thoughts.md) in that they're longer form and (hopefully) more refined. By that, I mean proof read and what not.

This is the kinda stuff I would actually care if someone else read because I'd want to be as accurate and interesting as I can manage.

## Metadata

The content block for an article would look a little like this:

```
---
type: article
title: This is an article
date: 1970-01-01
excerpt: I could have a short line here that gives an idea what this is about to the reader
---

This is my article. Here are some words.
