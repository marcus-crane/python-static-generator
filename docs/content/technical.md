# Technical

Not everything I talk about is always technical and not everyone who would want to subscribe to my site's RSS feed would be interested in techincal stuff.

My way to get around that is to just divide up the content I write about. In this case, technical posts can be thought of as just articles about technical topics.

Come to think of it, I could generate my RSS in a way that everything is in one feed but you could add a query string to filter out the sections you're not interested in.

A technical post may not always be tied to a language, such as setting up an operating system. Similarly, a technical post may span multiple languages so I'll have to think about it a bit more.
