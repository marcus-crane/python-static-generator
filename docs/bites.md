# Bites

These are basically half baked things that don't warrant a full post but are probably a little bit longer than a tweet, or at least something I don't want to be so throw away.

## Metadata

The content block for a bite would look a little like this:

```
---
type: bite
title: Is X even a thing?
date: 1970-01-01
---

I dunno, good question
```
